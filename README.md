# EECE-BSc-MSc-Thesis-Video-Game
As my thesis for my BSc - Integrated MSc in Electrical and Computer Engineering in the University of Thessaly i created a gamified simuation of a mandatory course called "Circuit Analysis 1".

This course had theory lectures and lab practices and the latter is what i tried to simulate using the Game Engine "Unity". During the lab we had access to breadboards, multimeters, many different electrocomponents such as resistances, capacitors, coils etc and more scientific equiment.
In this simulation I created a scene with a static top-down camera showing the top of desk and in the center of it a breadboard. The breadboard is static meaning it cannot move no matter the physics of other objects. It is connected to a battery and students could connect, disconncet from the battery and adjust the battery voltage.

From a digital drawer (UI) student could drag and drop different electrocomponents and place them / drop them on the desk, interact with them and of course place them on the breadboard in the specific position they wanted with the needed accuracy.

If they created a closed cirquit the game would notify them and calculate the output voltage this cirquit would have. It would notify them if the had made a mistake or didnt complete their thoughts thus redering the circuit open.

The scope of this game is for students to experiment with electrocomponents from the leisure of their home with equipment that they could only access in the University labs during specified hours and understand the practical side of the course better.
